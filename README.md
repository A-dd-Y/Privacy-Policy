Privacy Policy for nBook Extension
Effective Date: July 18, 2025

Thank you for using nBook. This privacy policy explains what information our extension handles and why. Our goal is to be as transparent as possible while providing you with a useful service.

1. What Information We Collect
We have designed nBook to collect the absolute minimum amount of information necessary for it to function.

User-Generated Content: The primary data we handle is the content you voluntarily type into the notebooks. This includes any text, formatting, and rich text content you create and save. This content is stored so that you can access it later and sync it across your devices.

Anonymous User ID: To sync your notes across different Chrome browsers, our extension uses Firebase Anonymous Authentication. This service generates a random, anonymous User ID (UID) for your installation of the extension. This UID is a string of random characters and is not linked to your name, email address, Google account, or any other personally identifiable information. Its sole purpose is to distinguish your notes from another user's notes in the database.

Locally Stored Preferences: To improve your experience, we use Chrome's local storage (chrome.storage.local) to save the ID of the last notebook you viewed. This is stored only on your local computer and allows the extension to open to the correct notebook the next time you use it.

Information We Do Not Collect
We want to be explicitly clear about what we do not collect:

We do not collect your name, email address, or any other personal contact information.

We do not track your browsing history or the websites you visit.

We do not collect any information from your computer other than what is described above.

2. How We Use Your Information
The information we handle is used exclusively for the following purposes:

To Provide Core Functionality: Your notebook content and anonymous UID are used to save your notes and sync them in real-time across your different Chrome browser instances.

To Improve User Experience: Storing your last-viewed notebook ID allows the extension to provide a more seamless and intuitive experience.

3. Data Storage and Security
Your notebook content is stored securely on Google Firebase's Firestore servers. Access to the database is protected by Firebase Security Rules, which are configured to only allow access to authenticated users of the extension. This prevents unauthorized parties from accessing your data.

4. Data Sharing
We do not sell, rent, trade, or share your data with any third parties for marketing, advertising, or any other purpose. The data is used only to provide the nBook service to you.

5. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We encourage you to review this policy periodically. Your continued use of the extension after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the new policy.

6. Contact Us
If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact.
